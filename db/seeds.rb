# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# require "csv"
#
# CSV.foreach('db/stacks.csv', headers: true) do |row|
#   # モデル名を
#   Company.create(:code => row[0], :name => row[1], :price_day => [2], :height_price_day => [3])
# end
